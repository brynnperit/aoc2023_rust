Note that the terms of use of advent of code prohibit redistribution of the samples, so you'll need to provide those on your own:

To make the tests run properly please visit https://adventofcode.com/2023/, log-in, navigate to the relevant day, and download the sample problem(s) and your specifically assigned input(s) into inputs/weekW/input_DD#_test and inputs/weekW/input_DD;

For day 10 this will look like inputs/week2/input_101_test, inputs/week2/input_10, inputs/week2/input_101_test, inputs/week2/input_102_test, and inputs/week2/input_10 . You'll also need to swap out the expected values in the tests for the correct values for your specific inputs.

A script to execute this process automatically will be written by me later on.
